### Hi there 👋

I'm Mathys Rituper, and I'm a French computer science student. I'm 19 years old I and use he/they pronouns.

## Education

🎓 I'm currently finishing my last year of DUT Informatique (Associate's Degree in IT) at the Grenoble Alpes University's Insitute of Technology 2.

💭 Moving on, I'd like to pursue my studies in cybersecurity, as I enjoy the mind game related with figuring out how to make things work the way I want them to.

## Skills & projects

⚙️  So far, I've mostly done front-end web development in my projects, using various JavaScript frameworks, such as Svelte, Vue or React. Take a look at fffgrenoble.fr or GoLocal Front-end projects !

🖥️ However, I'm also competent in a few other languages, mainly Python and Java. I use Python for scripting all kinds of stuff and automating tasks, like on csv2assises. But I also make games using these languages ! Check out TicTacToe (Android) or iut2-sb-gamejam :)

✏️ Software isn't all about coding. Designing enjoyable interfaces and experiences for users is something I stongly care about. I'm experimented with tools like Figma or Canva to create nice-looking visuals and interfaces for my projects !

## Causes and interests

🌿 Aside from computer science, I dedicate much of my free time to the cause of ecological and social justice, for which I am strongly committed. Although it is above all a fight for our global survival in a desirable world, it has taught me a lot about how to work as a group towards a common goal using soft skills that are less common among software developers (e.g. multi-team coordination, planning, public relations,...). I also got to learn a lot about myself and what I truely care about, in addition to being a life-defining experience.

📸 I've been doing photography for the last 5 years, in various conditions and objectives. But I always do it with the desire of conveying to others the energy and emotion of the moment when the photo was taken.

🧗 I'm a climber ! Although I'm far from competitive level, I really like challenging myself on new routes and boulders.
